How to implement Input as a Observer pattern?
    (I need to tell all running instances to exit, is this better than simply a bunch of returns?
    How would you even implement that?)

Should I add a Grid class that contains a HeroParty & SpaceFactory?
    From what I can tell it just adds overhead and messies up code
    as we can simply keep track where HeroParty is through HeroParty
    and handle logic as necessary, only concern is that a Board does contain
    a HeroParty, so tehcnically should be added.
        Same with board

Party.java
    I tried using generic types but Party contains a list of heroes. How and should I implement it with generic types?

Settings.java
    How do I ensure space proportions add up to one?

Is SpaceFactory a factory??

What is difference between abstract factory and normal factory?

Can armor extend item rather than implement? Does this break factory model?
